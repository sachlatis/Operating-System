# Operating Systems

This repository contains the programming exercises and the theory assignments for ECE NTUA course Operating Systems
## First Programming Exercise
Initially the father process creates the process C1, which reads a message from a .txt file and then the process C1 encrypts the message and saves it to another .txt file.
Then, the father process creates the process C2, which decrypts the saved message using the Caesars encryption algorithm
## Second Programming Exercise
Firstly the father process creates n child processes Ci. In this exercise we implement the father-child, child-father and user-father and user-child communication through the usage of signals. Moreover we use timers through the usage of alarm.
## Third Programming Exercise
The father process creates n child processes, Ci. In this exercise we implement the father-child data sharing through the usage of pipes. 
## Forth Programming Exercise
In the last exercise we examine the client-server communication. More specifically, we implement the client side communication and the server side was implemented from the tutor of this course. The server gave us information about the temperature, the timestamp etch.
